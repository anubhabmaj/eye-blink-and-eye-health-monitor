he leading theory explaining the correlation between digital screen use and dry eye syndrome posits that screen use alters blinking dynamics, decreasing both blink rate and completeness, which in turn leads to increased dryness of the ocular surface. This understanding is drawn from our extensive analysis of various research papers exploring this relationship. Based on these findings, we have developed an application designed to run in the background and monitor your blinking habits. It counts the frequency of your blinks, assesses your tear production, and studies your blinking dynamics. If these metrics fall below healthy levels, the application will issue an alert accordingly.


So our product aims to create an alert,detection and counter system to combat the problem.

Future projections
1)In Medical AI -doctors can use it for tear analysis(meniscus,aqueous component),blink dynamics,hyperblinkings,etc using deep learning

2)marketing companies can use it for analysing the reaction of customers
